II. Bagmch_deferred.txt

	(Sorry about the misleading name!)

	The only difference from Bagmch is that we pass ITEMS and max_elem as
	parameters

	Proof obligations:
	- 9 POs generated
	- 6 discharged with force 0
	- 3 not discharged automatically

	The POs (both discharged and not are *exactly* the same as in Bagmch.
