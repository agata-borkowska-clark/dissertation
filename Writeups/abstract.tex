			%\boldmath
			AtelierB is a tool for formal software development through refinement, using the B-method. It incorporates an automated prover, which has been recognized as the most thorough prover for B set theory, and has been used as a basis for many others. Nevertheless it has multiple shortcomings. Various approaches have been suggested and taken to improve its performance, including extensions to the proof rule base, created by the users. In this work we aim to create such an extension, ensuring that all added rules are sound and well-reasoned. We also aim to identify any limitations of this approach. The secondary goal is to improve the robustness of the software without straying from pure B method, and taking into account the ease of use. As a metric of our success, we use the benchmarks proposed by Conchon and Iguernlala\cite{survey}.

	\end{IEEEkeywords}}
	% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
	% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
	% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
	% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
	% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
	% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
	% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.
	
	% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

	% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
	% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext text will
	% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
	% here as \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
	% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
	% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
	% papers do!
	\IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext
	% \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext has no effect when using

	% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
	% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.
