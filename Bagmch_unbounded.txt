0. Bagmch_unbounded.mch
	In this variation on the theme we have a machine that is deliberately
	faulty. We have no limit on the number of items in the bag, and even the
	set of all items. This is erroneus because in order to implement this 
	machinewe must be able to show that the set has less than 2^32 elements

	Proof obiglations:
	- 4 POs generated
	- 3 proven automatically w/ force 0
	- 1 not discharged.

	The discharged POs are:

	1. INITIALISATION
		"Invariant is preserved"
		=> {} <: ITEMS

	2. OPERATION additem:
		"Invariant is preserved"
		=> content\/{aa} <: ITEMS

	3. OPERATION removeitem:
		"Invariant is preserved"
		=> content-{aa} <: ITEMS

	The undischarged PO is:
	1. Well-definedness of howmany:
		"Well definedness"
		=> content : FIN(content)

	This is quite correctly undischarged, because in an implementation this
	operation should return a value of type int, which is bounded by 2^32.
	Therefore, the cardinality of the set cannot exceed 2^32, and the set
	has to be finite.
